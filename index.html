            <p>Writing systems are not themselves human languages (with the debatable exception of computer languages);
                they
                are
                means of rendering a language into a form that can be reconstructed by other humans separated by time
                and/or
                space.[1][2] While not all languages use a writing system, those with systems of inscriptions can
                complement
                and
                extend capacities of spoken language by enabling the creation of durable forms of speech that can be
                transmitted
                across space (e.g., correspondence) and stored over time (e.g., libraries or other public records).[3]
                It
                has
                also been observed that the activity of writing itself can have</p>

                As human societies emerged, collective motivations for the development of writing were driven by
                pragmatic exigencies like keeping history, maintaining culture, codifying knowledge through curricula
